It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies.

Then the silence in the Zoo became complete.

Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.	Woil was afraid	entailment	6
But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.	marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake	entailment	7

She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy.

It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence.

That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all.

But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo.

Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration.

Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away.

Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it.

What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery?

``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice.

He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands.

Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him.

Indeed, in those busy days, our servants ' hall would often witness a gathering of some of the finest professionals in England talking late into the night by the warmth of the fire.

At this time of year not much, it's been a dryish summer, and there's not a lot of water coming down. Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate.

For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.	there was an age for puppets and magic	entailment	112
I spent just over an hour with Patterson which, I found out later, turned out to be another first. Time is money in the City and few people are worth an hour unless it's over lunch and only then if you're involved in a takeover bid. It was also I learned one of the few occasions anyone at PKB could remember that Patterson had a meeting with his door shut and nobody got fired.

The Deputy Under Secretary could talk of his host's prospects and disappointments, he could learn of the problems of digging out foreign exchange and hard currency in the Third World, the tribulations over the renewal of Residence Permits, the difficulties of keeping reliable servants, but of his own world he must remain silent. The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef... No bloody way. He was a man who could be honest with himself and in honesty he could say that he was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London.	the Deputy Under Secretary was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London	entailment	114

B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did.	he and his wife have as much as his parents did	contradiction	118
A: Well, how do you feel about the immigration laws? B: At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws.	he checked the topic off on the list	contradiction	119
B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.	he could really get killed that easily	contradiction	120
A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year.	he's going to have to worry about that next year	contradiction	121
A: Oh, oh yeah, and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat. B: Uh-huh. A: And you go crazy thinking it might be yours. B: Right, well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night.	her husband was such a sucker for animals	entailment	122
B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes,	it acts much as a deterrent to these people	contradiction	123
A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better	it could be better	contradiction	124
B: And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with	it is going to be that easy to come up with	contradiction	125
A: Yeah, they did. They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside. Uh, it's funny watching them play, he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks, uh, when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best. B: Uh-huh. A: And I haven't quite figured that out, if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing.	they have got it won	neutral	126
A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,	it should be unanimous	contradiction	127

B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it	it was his fault	contradiction	129
A: and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise. So, see, you know, there's different, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem B: Uh-huh. A: and I know that. But then, I have other views to it. B: I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period	it was that expensive	contradiction	130
B: I did, too. A: I mean, it was just more for my money. B: Yeah. I didn't think it was too long at all.	it was too long	contradiction	131
B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done.	it's done	contradiction	132
B: But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. A: Uh-huh.

A: Yeah, that's crazy. B: and then you come here in the Dallas area, um, I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles.	people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles	contradiction	137
B: but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too. A: Yeah.  True. B: Because it's, we've all got to do it right now. I just, I really amazed to find out that, eighty per cent are filled now, in garbage fills. In five years we're supposed to be at max. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think I can keep my own garbage.	she can keep her own garbage	contradiction	138

A:  nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever. A: Yeah. B: I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.	she has a philosophical problem with that	contradiction	140
B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. A: Uh-huh. B: That was fun. A: Golly, I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.	he has heard of that movie	contradiction	141
A: so it's nice to get away. It's just amazing, how much you miss. B: Yeah, it,  Yeah, it, yeah, it really is. I mean, I don't think I ever see the Little Dipper,	she has seen the Little Dipper	contradiction	142
B: Yeah. It's, uh, I have modem night computer so I can log into the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which can be useful. But, uh, yeah that and word processing is while I tend to, I mean, obviously, I do almost all of my report writing on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember, actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. TRS Eighty when they first came out.	he has used a typewriter to do a report	contradiction	143
A: I am right outside Baltimore. I am less than a mile from the Baltimore line. B: Um. A: And I go to a campus of the University of Maryland that is just, less than a mile from my house. So I'm actually in Baltimore, yeah, you could say I'm in Baltimore.	he is in Baltimore	entailment	144

B: I wouldn't be surprised. A: You know, because they don't want to send them to daycare. B: I doubt if they would say it was too long.	it was too long	contradiction	147
A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.	he would blame it directly on the school	contradiction	148
B: She says that when her husband died oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know. I mean, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's, A: Uh-huh. B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally.	she would do it to her parents	contradiction	149
A: Big time there, sure is. B: It surely is. A: I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself.	he would go to work without a bulletproof vest	contradiction	150
A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.	he would like the KGB monitoring his phone	contradiction	151
B: That might be kind of tough, huh. A: It really would, yes, yes, and like I said, my sister's still in it, and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either.	his mother would want to be there	contradiction	152
B: I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. A: Right.  And then do it all over again.  Uh-huh. B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective.	rehabilitation is effective	contradiction	153
B: Oh, well that's good. A: but she really doesn't. Nobody thought she would adjust,	she would adjust	contradiction	154
B: What am I afraid of? A: Yes. B: Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much. I just, uh, don't think that I need them, you know.	she needs them	contradiction	155
A: That's fairly interesting. B: I bet that would be, rather interesting. Uh, that's, uh, self improvement, well, that's kind of a hobby but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh. A: Yeah, I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.	she reads anything strictly labeled self improvement	contradiction	156
A: They might be, but not at the human factors level. they're, B: Well, I heard it on the news today, I could swear it was IBM.	it was IBM	entailment	157
A: But, uh, B: Okay.  Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from,	she would buy a Dodge	contradiction	158
B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked.	some kid should be exempt from being spanked	contradiction	159
B: I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right? A: Yes. B: And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? A: Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there.	some of her relatives would really like to go there	contradiction	160
A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently	somebody roots differently	contradiction	161
B: if you get it on sale, A: Yeah, yeah, so we bought that or we bought the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets, and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them.	someone in his house knows the difference	contradiction	162
A: Have you followed that very much or, B: Uh, not really. I don't think anything will ever take over the NFL.	something will take over the NFL	contradiction	163
B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it.	something's going to be done about it	contradiction	164
A: Oh, yes. Animals have a way of talking. B: Alfie did. I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day. A: I don't know uh, that I'd trade my dog in for the world.	he would trade his dog in for the world	contradiction	165
A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,	speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year	contradiction	166
A: I got a friend who goes there, by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay. B: Okay. Uh, I've, the high school I went to uh, was a good one also. And well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools.	one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools	entailment	167
A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.	switching back and forth is that big a deal	contradiction	168
A: And now it's election time again so they're trying to lower them. B: Oh. A: So they're just talk about lowering them but they never do, they just keep raising them. B: I've never seen taxes really go down.	taxes would really go down	contradiction	169
B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.	that attitude would stay negative very long	contradiction	170
B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work.	that is going to work	contradiction	171
B: Right. And they repacked the wheel bearings. A: and they repacked the the wheel bearings. Yeah but, uh, I've had considerable experience. you might say I'm, uh, uh, good back yard mechanic	she is a good back yard mechanic	entailment	172
A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty. A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.	that would be bad	contradiction	173
B: I think in s-, and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere.	that's done much anywhere	contradiction	174
A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage.	the American people are being shortchanged by the news coverage	contradiction	175
B: Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from, A: Um. B: well, actually, I had uh, a Dodge Omni at one point A: Uh-huh. B: and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.	the Dodge Omni was a very quality car	contradiction	176
A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.	the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down	contradiction	177
A: Boy that's scary, isn't it. B: Oh, can you imagine, because it happens in the middle of the night, so you know, these parents didn't know the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming, let me in.	the kid was gone	entailment	178
B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more, and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,	as many parents are college educated at the public school	contradiction	179
B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true.

But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to, I mean, I don't think that law will ever change.	the law will change	contradiction	180
B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding. I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way	the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way	contradiction	181
A: I think so, I think, B: I really do. Oh, yeah, it's going to take, uh, you know, the police, I don't think can do it alone, you know.	the police can do it alone	contradiction	182
A: How do you feel about that. B: I don't really, I more, I don't know about the government as much as, uh, the people, uh, I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore.	the Soviet Union itself is a threat still	contradiction	183
B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.	the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television	entailment	184
B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news. A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A: I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.	the way she gets the news is the right way to get it	contradiction	185
B: Well, you've got, well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such, A: Uh-huh. B: And they get out their little Mac tens, they get out their little uzis and they're going to fight with them. And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm. If they want it they'll get it. I don't care if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border. Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon, anyway. A: Uh-huh. B: Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it.	there should be that big of a restriction on it	contradiction	186
B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards.

Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before.

A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess.

B: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded, but the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know, I mean, because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws, and the prison system are just, you know, they're trying to cope with them, but, you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know, a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to future crime,	capital punishment would be a deterrent to future crimes	contradiction	236

His attorneys claim he was framed by the FBI and New York police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s.
